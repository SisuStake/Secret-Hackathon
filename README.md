## Sisu Stake Secret Hackathon Team Project Overview

Deposit SILK --> the contract then buys LPs @ 25% each (SILK + CMST -- SILK + USDT -- SILK + USDC [all these are Shade pools] + saUSDC + saUSDT [blizzard finance]) --> contract can claim all rewards associated with each LP --> all rewards are traded for SILK once a quarter --> SILK is deposited into Shade Earn (found in their borrow section) --> rewards from 'earn' are claimed by the contract and sent to the owners wallet once each quarter.
