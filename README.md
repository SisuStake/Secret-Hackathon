# Secret-Hackathon
## Sisu Stake Secret Hackathon Team Project Overview

Name: Secret Angels: The Secret Stable 

Track: Shade Protocol 

Product: An NFT that can wrap LP tokens from the [Shade Pools]([url](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/pools)) powering the [Shade DEX]([url](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap)) and then be used for [Shade Borrow]([url](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/borrow)). The value of the NFT needs to be updated based on the performance/value of the LP tokens wrapped into it (or held by it). For the Hackathon it would be ideal to make ONLY the stablecoin pools possible to wrap into the NFT: 

Silk + USDC.axl 
Silk + USDT.axl 
Silk + CMST
(BONUS: LP from [Blizzard Finance]([url](https://app.blizzard.finance/pools))): saUSDC + saUSDT
